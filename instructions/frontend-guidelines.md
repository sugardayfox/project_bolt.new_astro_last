# Frontend Guidelines

## Design Principles
- **User-Centric Design**: Prioritize the needs and preferences of users in every design decision. Ensure that the interface is intuitive and accessible.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that the application is accessible to users with disabilities, including screen readers, keyboard navigation, and color contrast.
- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent look and feel across all pages and components to enhance usability and brand recognition.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the application looks great and functions well on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Simplicity**: Strive for a clean and minimalistic design that avoids clutter and distractions, allowing users to focus on the content.

## Styling Instructions
- **CSS Framework**: Use Tailwind CSS for styling, leveraging its utility-first approach to create responsive designs quickly.
- **Custom Styles**: Create custom styles only when necessary, ensuring they align with the overall design principles and do not conflict with Tailwind's classes.

## Page Layout
- **Grid System**: Utilize a grid system for layout consistency. Ensure that elements are aligned properly and maintain adequate spacing between them.
- **Hero Section**: Design a visually appealing hero section on the homepage that includes a compelling headline, a brief description, and a call-to-action button. Also do the same for Blog posts. 
- **Content Sections**: Organize content into clear sections with headings and subheadings to improve readability and navigation.

## Navigation
- **NavBar**: Implement a responsive navigation bar that includes links to the main sections of the application (e.g., Home, Resources, Blog).
- **Dropdown Menus**: Use dropdown menus for language selection and any additional navigation options to keep the interface clean.
- **Footer Links**: Include footer links that repeat key navigation items and provide access to social media links and copyright information.

## Template Color Palette
- **Primary Colors**:
  - Background: `#FFFFFF` (White)
  - Text: `#808080` (Mid-Grey)

- **Contrasting Colors**:
  - Accent Color: `#007BFF` (Bright Blue) for buttons and links.
  - Secondary Accent: `#28A745` (Green) for success messages or highlights.
  - Error Color: `#DC3545` (Red) for error messages or alerts.

## Fonts
- **Font Family**: Select a modern and legible font for body text, ensuring it aligns with the overall design aesthetic.
- **Headings**: Use a distinctive font or style for headings to create hierarchy and draw attention to important content.
- **Font Sizes**: Establish a clear scale for font sizes, maintaining consistency across different text elements (e.g., headings, subheadings, body text).
