# Announcment Bar 

- Feature 1: Announcement bar. It should be shown only on first visit (see cookies). Above the NavBar. Can be closed by the user through an interactive (x) in the top right corner of the Announcement bar. Should be shown everywhere but only once in a user session.
- Feature 6: Make the announcement bar responsive. But rather shrink it on smaller screens than stacking the text on top of each other. Or just show the first parts of the text.

## Issues overcome (mainly with Claude)

It was at the end the navbar having a lower z- (z-50) that I needed to bump it up to z-100.
