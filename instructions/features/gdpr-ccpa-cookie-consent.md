# Feature 22:

 We need a proper GDPR notice in a popover for European visitors, CCPA for US visitors. If possible we'll use an external cookie consent library. To make it easy, if we can add vibe then we should.
 
 ## Implementation

 Unfortunately I went with npm installing cookie consent that triggered a full upgrade to astro and vite with breaking changes so now we have a non-working site :( 

## then asked Windsurf 20 something days later
and it worked like a charm with CookieYes.
