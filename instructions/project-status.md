# Project status doc
  
This doc functions as a work log for AI model.  
It should record what steps it already completed, what step it is working on, what's left.  
  
This will help you open up your project anytime and AI will pick up from where it left.  
  
I ask AI to update this document after every major feature completion. 

Need to add to to .windsurfrules file. 

## Log

- added announcment bar
- added CookieYes for cookie consent management via GoogleTagManager
- Removed Googlethis from the project as we will only implement a search within the site's content.
- Rolled it back to last working version. 
- Tried to add AnnouncementBar to the project. But a weird shiki.js related isse occurred, so we did add the feature to our project backlog.
